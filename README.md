# Aureus Wealth Terminal

Aureus is a local-first, visualization-first Personal Wealth Intelligence Terminal for macOS.

The product is designed around CNY and USD, with CNY as the default unified valuation currency. It keeps original-currency values, exchange-rate context, and converted values distinct. AI and LLM capabilities are outside the product's long-term scope.

Planned product areas are:

- Dashboard
- Wealth
- Markets
- Portfolio
- Analytics
- Ledger
- Goals
- Settings

Privacy is a hard boundary: real accounts, balances, holdings, transactions, databases, backups, credentials, and private imports or exports must not enter the future public repository. Demos and tests may use only synthetic or sanitized data.

## Current Status

Stage 1 is frozen: **Reviewer Gate PASS — 2026-08-11**. Stage 2 foundation work has begun and now provides a native SwiftUI app shell, GRDB-backed persistence foundation, and Unit/UI test targets. Stage 3 wealth-management business features have not begun.

Twelve Data is the frozen Primary Market Data Provider, using a user-owned API key (BYOK) and plan-aware entitlements: Basic Free is the usable US-focused entry path, while complete US/HK/mainland-China/Japan capability depends on the user's Pro-or-higher entitlement and later Stage 6 verification. Stage 2 contains provider-independent contracts only; it does not make live Provider requests.

## Build and Test

Resolve the single external dependency, GRDB 7.11.1:

```sh
xcodebuild -resolvePackageDependencies -project Aureus.xcodeproj -scheme Aureus
```

Build the arm64 Debug app and all test products in isolated DerivedData:

```sh
xcodebuild -project Aureus.xcodeproj -scheme Aureus -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' -derivedDataPath /private/tmp/Aureus-Stage2-DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build
xcodebuild -project Aureus.xcodeproj -scheme Aureus -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' -derivedDataPath /private/tmp/Aureus-Stage2-DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build-for-testing
```

Run the complete Unit/Integration suite, then the UI suite. The UI test runner uses only local ad-hoc signing and does not require a Development Team:

```sh
xcodebuild -project Aureus.xcodeproj -scheme Aureus -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' -derivedDataPath /private/tmp/Aureus-Stage2-DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO test -only-testing:AureusTests
xcodebuild -project Aureus.xcodeproj -scheme Aureus -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' -derivedDataPath /private/tmp/Aureus-Stage2-DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=YES CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY=- test -only-testing:AureusUITests
```

The specific open-source license has not yet been frozen. All Git and GitHub operations are managed manually by the user.
