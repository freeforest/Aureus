# Aureus Wealth Terminal

Aureus is a local-first, visualization-first Personal Wealth Intelligence Terminal for macOS.

The product is designed around CNY and USD, with CNY as the default unified valuation currency. It keeps original-currency values, exchange-rate context, and converted values distinct. AI and LLM capabilities are outside the product's long-term scope.

Planned product areas are:

- Dashboard
- Wealth
- Markets
- Portfolio
- Analytics
- Ledger
- Goals
- Settings

Privacy is a hard boundary: real accounts, balances, holdings, transactions, databases, backups, credentials, and private imports or exports must not enter the future public repository. Demos and tests may use only synthetic or sanitized data.

## Current Status

Stages 1 through 4 are frozen after Reviewer Gate PASS. The current state is **Stage 5 Implementation Candidate — Awaiting Reviewer Gate**. The native Wealth workspace supports persistent Container CRUD, CNY aggregation, and manual USD → CNY valuation with retained FX provenance. The Ledger workspace supports the eight frozen transaction kinds, transfer-neutral cash-flow summaries, Categories and Tags, deterministic local classification rules, and previewed/atomic Aureus Ledger V1 CSV import plus native CSV export. The Dashboard now uses self-contained permanent daily Snapshots for wealth history and native Apple Swift Charts for current wealth, change metrics, historical series, allocation, container values, cash flow, and accessible heatmaps. Empty production stores remain empty; deterministic Dashboard history exists only in isolated synthetic Demo/Test stores.

Twelve Data is the frozen Primary Market Data Provider, using a user-owned API key (BYOK) and plan-aware entitlements: Basic Free is the usable US-focused entry path, while complete US/HK/mainland-China/Japan capability depends on the user's Pro-or-higher entitlement and later Stage 6 verification. Provider integration remains outside Stage 5; the app contains provider-independent contracts only and does not make live Provider requests.

## Build and Test

Resolve the single external dependency, GRDB 7.11.1:

```sh
xcodebuild -resolvePackageDependencies -project Aureus.xcodeproj -scheme Aureus
```

Build the arm64 Debug app and all test products in isolated DerivedData:

```sh
xcodebuild -project Aureus.xcodeproj -scheme Aureus -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' -derivedDataPath /private/tmp/Aureus-Stage5-DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build
xcodebuild -project Aureus.xcodeproj -scheme Aureus -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' -derivedDataPath /private/tmp/Aureus-Stage5-DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build-for-testing
```

Run the complete Unit/Integration suite, then the UI suite. The UI test runner uses only local ad-hoc signing and does not require a Development Team:

```sh
xcodebuild test -project Aureus.xcodeproj -scheme Aureus -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' -derivedDataPath /private/tmp/Aureus-Stage5-DerivedData -only-testing:AureusTests CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
xcodebuild test -project Aureus.xcodeproj -scheme Aureus -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' -derivedDataPath /private/tmp/Aureus-Stage5-UI-DerivedData -only-testing:AureusUITests
```

The specific open-source license has not yet been frozen. All Git and GitHub operations are managed manually by the user.
