# Aureus Wealth Terminal

Aureus is a local-first, visualization-first Personal Wealth Intelligence Terminal for macOS.

The product is designed around CNY and USD, with CNY as the default unified valuation currency. It keeps original-currency values, exchange-rate context, and converted values distinct. AI and LLM capabilities are outside the product's long-term scope.

Planned product areas are:

- Dashboard
- Wealth
- Markets
- Portfolio
- Analytics
- Ledger
- Goals
- Settings

Privacy is a hard boundary: real accounts, balances, holdings, transactions, databases, backups, credentials, and private imports or exports must not enter the future public repository. Demos and tests may use only synthetic or sanitized data.

## Current Status

Stages 1 through 5 are frozen after Reviewer Gate PASS. The current state is **Stage 6NBA Search Classification Candidate — Awaiting Reviewer Gate**. Prompt 6N received Reviewer Gate `FAIL`, Prompt 6NA received `PARTIAL`, Prompt 6NAA received `PASS`, and Prompt 6NB received `PARTIAL`. Wealth, Ledger, and Dashboard continue to use the Permanent Store. Stage 6 adds a Twelve Data `URLSession`/`Codable` adapter, native Keychain-only BYOK lifecycle, Frankfurter/ECB reference FX, a physically independent bounded Market Cache, typed TTL/LRU cleanup, offline/stale states, and minimal Provider/cache controls in Settings. Stage 6D local correctness and native UI regression repairs remain intact. Markets remains an honest Stage 7 Placeholder and Stage 7 remains `NO-GO`.

Twelve Data remains the selected Primary Market Data Provider under **Personal Local Mode**: Aureus runs only on one user's Mac for personal/internal, non-commercial use; it is not a hosted service and does not redistribute or commercially display Provider data. Open source applies to program source, not Provider data, credentials, or user financial data. Basic Free remains the usable US-focused entry path, while every endpoint and MIC remains governed by the actual Plan and exchange entitlement.

Twelve Data Production data is session-only in V1. Search, Quote, OHLCV, and entitled Corporate Actions route through one dependency-injected, actor-owned 64 MiB transient memory store with typed TTL, deterministic LRU, checked logical byte accounting, lifecycle clearing, and no serialization or cross-launch recovery. Stage 6MA makes exact expiry stale, clears the complete Provider session before returning confirmed credential/entitlement loss, generation-checks every fresh, stale-fallback, stored, and oversize return, routes Settings Clear through the service lifecycle boundary, and requires complete Split plus Dividend state. Production persistent Twelve Data writes are **Disabled by product policy**; query paths neither read nor write Twelve Data disk rows, and startup performs a Provider-scoped legacy-row purge. Retention rights remain `BLOCKED`, but this deferred disk-cache question is no longer proposed as a permanent Stage 7 implementation blocker. Minimal user-authored symbol/MIC identifiers and UI preferences may persist without Provider descriptions or values.

Stage 6NB used one exact signed acceptance App for user takeover and established only the broad terminal `SEARCH_PROVIDER_ERROR`; Reviewer Gate was `PARTIAL`. Stage 6NBA then added a temporary exhaustive sanitized error mapper and transparent attempt counter, passed 3/3 synthetic taxonomy tests, built one exact signed App/UI Runner, and had the system open that exact App and navigate to Settings before user takeover. Binary, bundle, entitlement, signing, and temporary-source hashes were unchanged across takeover, and transport attempts remained zero. The one categorical preflight passed 1/1 as `CONFIGURED` with zero attempts. The only authorized live Search then passed its 1/1 harness assertions but ended as typed terminal `SEARCH_INVALID_PAYLOAD`, with exactly one transport attempt and one local attempted credit unit; Provider-account billed credits remain `NOT AVAILABLE`. No Historical or other endpoint was called. Session data was cleared before and after, Twelve Data persistent rows stayed zero, and Frankfurter/ECB, unrelated Market Cache, and Permanent Store sentinels were unchanged. Temporary App/Test changes were byte-restored. Basic US Search/OHLCV, Actual Plan, Quote, Corporate Actions, freshness, other US MICs, and `XHKG`/`XSHG`/`XSHE`/`XJPX` remain `NOT VERIFIED`.

The 2026-08-17 Terms refresh records §12.5 as immediate cessation of access with a deletion obligation and §16.2 as the operational deadline to delete within 30 days after termination or expiration. Aureus keeps immediate Provider-scoped purge as a stricter internal policy, not as a claimed Provider deadline. `/api_usage` remains `NOT VERIFIED`. No Provider request or Support message was performed in Stage 6MA.

## Build and Test

Resolve the single external dependency, GRDB 7.11.1:

```sh
xcodebuild -resolvePackageDependencies -project Aureus.xcodeproj -scheme Aureus
```

Build the arm64 Debug app and all test products in isolated DerivedData:

```sh
xcodebuild -project Aureus.xcodeproj -scheme Aureus -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' -derivedDataPath /private/tmp/Aureus-Stage6NA-DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build
xcodebuild -project Aureus.xcodeproj -scheme Aureus -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' -derivedDataPath /private/tmp/Aureus-Stage6NA-DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build-for-testing
```

Run the complete Unit/Integration suite, then the UI suite. The UI test runner uses only local ad-hoc signing and does not require a Development Team:

```sh
xcodebuild test -project Aureus.xcodeproj -scheme Aureus -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' -derivedDataPath /private/tmp/Aureus-Stage6NA-DerivedData -only-testing:AureusTests CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
xcodebuild test -project Aureus.xcodeproj -scheme Aureus -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' -derivedDataPath /private/tmp/Aureus-Stage6NA-UI-DerivedData -only-testing:AureusUITests
```

The specific open-source license has not yet been frozen. All Git and GitHub operations are managed manually by the user.
